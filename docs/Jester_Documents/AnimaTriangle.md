## 🧩 Introduction

``gpKernelDesignerConfig->anima_weapon_triangle``

This feature recreates the **anima magic triangle** from **Fire Emblem 4 and 5**, where anima spells interact with one another similarly to traditional weapon and magic triangles.

---

## 🛠️ Plan

The system follows the classic FE4/FE5 structure:

- **Fire → Wind/Ice**
- **Wind/Ice → Thunder**
- **Thunder → Fire**

The configuration supports **up to three anima types**, arranged in a triangular advantage/disadvantage relationship.
