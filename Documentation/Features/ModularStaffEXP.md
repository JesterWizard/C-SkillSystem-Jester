## 🧩 Introduction

`CONFIG_MODULAR_STAFF_EXP`

In vanilla **FE8**, staff EXP gains are heavily hardcoded.  
This hack replaces that behavior with a **modular EXP system** that allows full control over how much EXP each staff use grants.

---

## 🛠️ Plan

A custom function, `StaffEXP`, acts as a centralized EXP controller.

It includes:

- A **switch-case table** that defines EXP for all vanilla staves  
- Support for **custom staves** with their own EXP values  
- Room for **conditional rules**, such as:  
  - Staves that don’t grant EXP to certain units  
  - Staves that only grant EXP in specific contexts  
  - Staves that scale EXP based on class, item durability, or map state  

This gives complete creative freedom over staff experience design.
